    <h2>Non-existent Classroom</h2>
    <p>In a small mountain barangay where signal barely reached and textbooks were shared by three students at a time,
       Grade 4 learner Althea discovered a “classroom” that existed only through a donated tablet and a weak but persistent 
       internet connection. Every night, she sat outside their house, holding the screen under a kerosene lamp, determined 
       to prove that learning doesn’t require walls—only opportunity.</p>

    <h2>One Teacher, Many Dreams</h2>
    <p>Sir Ramon bikes 12 kilometers a day carrying a bag full of modules, chalk, and snacks he buys using his own allowance. 
      For him, each house he visits is not just a delivery route—it’s a step toward making sure that every child in his remote 
      barangay sees themselves as capable, valued, and worthy of quality education.</p>

    <h2>Feet Full of Dust</h2>
    <p>Seven-year-old Arianne walked five kilometers on a dirt road every day, carrying a plastic bag with one pencil and a 
      borrowed notebook. Her feet were always covered in dust, and she often skipped breakfast, but she never skipped school. 
      She believed that if she kept walking, one day the future would meet her halfway.</p>

      <h3>Letters With No Paper</h3>
      <div class="meta">By Jane D. • Cebu • 7 min read</div>
      <p class="excerpt">
        Teacher Ramon stayed after class each day to hand-draw worksheets because his school had no printer, no photocopier, 
        not even enough paper. When supplies ran out, he tore pages from his own old notebooks, giving the children whatever 
        he had left. To him, every scrap meant one more chance for a child to understand.

      <h3>When the Chalk Turned to Dust</h3>
      <div class="meta">By Bea B. • Davao • 6 min read</div>
      <p class="excerpt">
        The last chalk in Teacher Liza’s hand crumbled into dust, leaving the board empty and the lesson unfinished. Her 
        students watched quietly, waiting, hopeful. With nothing left to write, she continued teaching with only her 
        voice—determined not to let their dreams fade as quickly as the chalk.

      <h3>The Bicycle Library</h3>
      <div class="meta">By Ran T. • Albay • 6 min read</div>
      <p class="excerpt">
        Once a week, the sound of a bicycle bell echoed through Sitio Kalaw. The children would run outside, knowing that
         Kuya Jonas, the traveling librarian, had arrived. His bike—painted bright blue—was fitted with wooden shelves 
         filled with storybooks, worksheets, and coloring pages. Even if the village had no library building, Kuya Jonas 
         found a way to bring books to every doorstep.
